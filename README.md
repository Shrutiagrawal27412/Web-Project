## Introduction

Safe Notes is a secure note-taking application built using React and CSS. It provides users with a safe way to store notes, links, and passwords. The application features data encryption, and all data is stored locally on the user's device. A passkey is used to secure and unlock the application.

## About the Project

Safe Notes is designed to be a versatile and secure note-taking application. It consists of three main sections:

1. **Notes**: Users can create, edit, and delete notes with titles and descriptions. The notes are searchable, allowing users to find specific information quickly.
2. **Links**: Users can store and manage useful links, providing easy access to frequently used websites. The links are also searchable by title.
3. **Passwords**: Users can securely store passwords for future reference. All password data is encrypted before being stored in the indexed DB.

To enhance security, a 4-digit passkey is used to lock and unlock the application. Data is encrypted while stored in the indexed DB, ensuring the safety of sensitive information.
